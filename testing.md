# Testing

These are ROS2 commands that can be used to verify the correct operation of the Raspberry Pi monitor.  Each command is prefixed with a comment that explains the expected response.

## Tests

Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi and launch the monitor program.

```bash
cd ~/pipebot_4wd_ws
. ./install/setup.bash
ros2 launch rpi_monitor monitor.launch.py
```

In a second terminal window, verify that the `/diagnostics` topic is present using:

```bash
$ cd ~/pipebot_4wd_ws
$ . ./install/setup.bash
$ ros2 topic list
/diagnostics
/parameter_events
/rosout
```

Echo the `/diagnostics` topic and verify that you see something like this:

```bash
$ ros2 topic echo /diagnostics
header:
  stamp:
    sec: 1685286347
    nanosec: 31482782
  frame_id: ''

```

Verify that the following items are present:

* CPU temperature.
* CPU usage.
* RAM usage.
